**Gen6+ portable PokÃ©mon info viewer.**

If you want a more invasive homebrew that allows modifications, check out [**PKSM**](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/PKSM/)

## Installation

Download and install the latest release with your favourite installation method. When booted, the application will download automatically the required additional assets from a third party source. You can provide your own assets, if you want.

If you're using Homebrew Launcher, make sure you have it updated to the [latest version](https://smealum.github.io/ninjhax2/starter.zip).

If you're using Homebrew Launcher and you don't have the latest firmware on your console, you may want to use **ctr-httpwn** to get internet access and let the application download everything correctly. If you can't still download them through the application, you can put them manually in the SD card, putting the external [additionalassets folder](https://github.com/dsoldier/PKResources) in your SD card, located at ` /3ds/data/PKSM/ `. To avoid troubles, the final result should be a folder filled with assets, located at ` /3ds/data/PKSM/additionalassets/ `.

## Compiling

You need devKitPro, ctrulib, sf2d, sfil, sftd and Xerpi's portlibs to be able to compile this.
